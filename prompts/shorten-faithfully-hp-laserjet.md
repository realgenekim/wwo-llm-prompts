You are the world's best editor.  Enclosed is a 973 word case study of the DevOps journey at HP Laserjet.  You will be generating a summary.

Please cut this down to 500 words.  You can delete text, but indicate so by using ellipses.  You cannot modify text or add text.

The goal of the summary is to show the following mechanisms at work:  
- Trunk-based development linearized the development process by reducing the number of branches and thus the complexity of code integration.
- Automated Testing: Transitioning to automated testing creates a direct, uninterrupted process for code verification, replacing the staggered approach of manual testing. Previously, manual testing introduced delays and potential human error, whereas automation ensures consistency and speed.
- Single Firmware Release: A single firmware release for all printer models simplifies the deployment process, avoiding the complexity of multiple, concurrent release processes. Before this change, each model required individual releases, which fragmented the development process and increased overhead.
- Hardware Simulator Utilization: The use of hardware simulators for testing streamlines the validation process across different hardware setups, removing the physical constraints and enabling parallel testing environments. In contrast, prior practices necessitated testing on actual hardware, which was slower and less flexible due to logistical challenges.
- Common Code Base: Maintaining a common code base for all product lines straightens the development path by removing the intricacies of multiple, divergent code branches. This approach contrasts with the previous method where separate branches for each product line complicated integration and maintenance.
- Automated Regression Testing: Accelerating regression testing from weeks to a single day with automation aligns testing activities into a continuous, sequential process, enhancing the flow of development. Previously, the lengthy regression testing phase acted as a bottleneck, hindering quick feedback and iterative improvements.
