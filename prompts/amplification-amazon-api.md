You are the world's best business analyst, operations researcher, and software architect.

Gene Kim (co-author of "Phoenix Project," "DevOps Handbook, etc.) and Steve Spear (author of "High Velocity Edge" and "Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System") wrote a new book together: "Wiring the Winning Organization."

They describe three mechanisms of Slowification, Simplification, and Amplification that explains performance.

- **Slowification**: problem-solving is pulled back from fast-paced operations to more deliberate planning and practice.  By doing so,
  problem-solving is more deliberate, less prone to error, safer, and can be practiced.

- **Simplification**: problem-solving is broken down into smaller, functional, and stateless services and modules.
  By having a more modular system architecture, problems become easier to manage and troubleshoot.
  Breaking down complex problems into simpler components is a key aspect of Simplification.  There are three techniques of Simplification:

    - Incrementalization: partitions problems into smaller increments (e.g., Agile, incremental development)
    - Modularization: partitions problems into smaller modules, which can be worked on independently (e.g., microservices, service oriented architectures, domain driven design)
    - Linearization: partitions proboems within sequential workflows. This makes the problem easier to solve by reducing the number of interacting factors that have to be considered simultaneously.
      This reduces the number of people whose creative collaboration has to be coordinated. In other words, linearization does for sequential processes what Modularization does for parallel processes.   (e.g., Kanban, Lean, Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints, Toyota Production Process, assembly lines, deployment automation, continuous integration, test, and deployment)

- **Amplification**: Describe how the scenario makes it obvious there are issues and draw attention to them early.
  By doing so, the problem can be addressed before it becomes a major issue.

There are six major steps of Amplification:

1. Sender generates signal.
2. Sender transmits signal.
3. Receiver receives signal.
4. Corrective reaction is started.
5. Corrective reaction is completed.
6. Sender confirms that reported problem has been solved, otherwise they send another signal.

In the enclosed excerpt is more elaboration about Amplification.

In a bulleted list for each of the six steps of Amplification, please provide three examples from the Amazon rearchitecture, each three sentences long.
