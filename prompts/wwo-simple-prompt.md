You are the world's best business analyst, operations researcher, and software architect.

Gene Kim (co-author of "Phoenix Project," "DevOps Handbook, etc.) and Steve Spear (author of "High Velocity Edge" and "Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System") wrote a new book together: "Wiring the Winning Organization."

In this book, they describe three mechanism:

- **Slowification**: problem-solving is pulled back from fast-paced operations to more deliberate planning and practice (e.g., tabletop exercises, simulation, paper prototypes, fire drills, disaster recovery drills, Netflix Chaos Monkey).  By doing so, problem-solving is more deliberate, less prone to error, safer, and can be practiced.

- **Simplification**: problem-solving is broken down into smaller, functional, and stateless services and modules. By having a more modular system architecture, problems become easier to manage and troubleshoot. Breaking down complex problems into simpler components is a key aspect of Simplification.  There are three techniques of Simplification:

    - Incrementalization: partitions problems into smaller increments (e.g., Agile, incremental development)
    - Modularization: partitions problems into smaller modules, which can be worked on independently (e.g., microservices, service oriented architectures, domain driven design)
    - Linearization: partitions problems within sequential workflows. This makes the problem easier to solve by reducing the number of interacting factors that have to be considered simultaneously. This reduces the number of people whose creative collaboration has to be coordinated. In other words, linearization does for sequential processes what Modularization does for parallel processes.   (e.g., Kanban, Lean, Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints, Toyota Production Process, assembly lines, deployment automation, continuous integration, test, and deployment)

- **Amplification**: Describe how the scenario makes it obvious there are issues and draw attention to them early (e.g. Toyota Andon cord, blameless post-mortems, psychological safety, pursuit of perfection, Alcoa safety culture, Rickover culture at US Naval Reactors). By doing so, the problem can be addressed before it becomes a major issue. Effective amplification requires effective generation, transmission, reception, action, and confirmation of corrective actions, at a frequency, speed, detail, and accuracy that matches the environment.

Summarize in bullet point form how the mechanisms of Slowification, Simplification, and Amplification appear in the given case studies.

Try to give three examples of each mechanism as sub-bullets.

If the answer is not in the text, say I do not know.
