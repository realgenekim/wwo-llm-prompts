The goal of the summary is to show the following mechanisms at work:  
Slowification:

Nordstrom decided to slow down and conduct a value stream mapping exercise to determine whether the COBOL application was the problem or if there was a larger issue that needed to be addressed.
This involved assembling everyone with any accountability for delivering value to their internal customers, including business partners, the mainframe team, and the shared service teams.
The process allowed them to identify inefficiencies in the process, such as department managers having to leave the store floor to fill out a form in the back office.


Simplification:

The value stream mapping exercise simplified the problem by breaking it down and identifying the root cause.
They discovered that the problem was not the COBOL application itself, but the process of submitting the "product line assignment" request form.
By identifying this, they were able to focus on simplifying and improving this process, rather than attempting to migrate the entire application off the mainframe.

Amplification:

The issue with the "product line assignment" request form was amplified when they realized that department managers were being asked for an employee number they didn't have, leading to incomplete forms and wasted time.
The need to leave the store floor to fill out the form was also identified as a significant inconvenience and inefficiency in the process.
By amplifying these issues, they were able to address them directly and improve the overall process.
